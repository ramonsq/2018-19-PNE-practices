Here I am going to take my notes

program C = client
program S = server

When the client sends a request to the server, the server responds to the client's request, this happens to every client
trying to connect to the server. if there aren't any requests, nothing happens, if if there is a request and no server,
the client would not get a response.

The requests can be made from any electronic device (phone, computer, tablet...)

To answer the requests there can be more than one servers running at the same time, at the same time that the client can
connect to more than one server. You can have a client and a server in the same computer.

Both, client and server, are connected through a network, internet.

Inside the internet there are many isolated computers connected to each other inside different networks, and if we want
to send a message from the client to the server we need an IP address, all computers connected to internet have a
network interface and some of them more than one, each one correspond to a different IP so a computer can have more than
one IP address, because they depend to the computer they are connected to.

My phone IP address at URJC is: 10.3.52.107
My phone IP address at home is:

Are them the same?

My computer lab IP is: 212.128.253.89
teacher's: 212.128.253.64

The Ping is the a command that says if your computer is alive.

* ping time to 8.8.8.8:
time = 3.56 ms

* ping time to my computer:
time = 0.064 ms

* ping time to another computer in the same network:
time = 0.058 ms

* ping time to my phone:
time = 64.8 ms

* IP address from www.google.com: 216.58.211.228
ping time = 3.75 ms

* ping time to urjc.es:
time = 2.30 ms

We need the IP address to communicate to a server, but if there are more than one application to a server, we can
identify each app with the port number. Usually the main app has the number port 80, but the other ones has the other
numbers (e.x. 8080)
